# Configure Splits
Because this program works by virtually pressing your Split Key every time a "valid" blackscreen is detected, you somehow have to tell it, which blackscreens are considered "valid".
Internally, the program counts how many blackscreens it encountered so far and only presses the Split Key if the current black screen count is listed in [splits.txt](splits.txt).
Enter your valid blackscreen count values one per line into [splits.txt](splits.txt) like this:
```
1
3
5
```
This example would cause the program to split at the first, third and fifth blackscreen it encounters, but it will skip any other blackscreens.
